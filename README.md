# Collaborative_ML_on_Chain

In this project, we implement our collaborative machine learning (ML) training platform for data sharing:

- When an agent uploads the data and deposit to the platform, the ML model will be trained with the new data. 
- Then, the agent will get areward or punishment, which is closely related to the model performance, and the remaining deposit (refund) computed by the incentive mechanism on the blockchain.
- The blockchain also records all the transaction data and the incentive mechanism defined in the smart contract.
